Senior Level
============

Mark up the attached comp using HTML/CSS (No external CSS libraries please).
It should be visually accurate to the comp in IE9+, Firefox, and WebKit browsers 

Add the following functionality:
A user must be able to add an item to the list, and remove one or more items from the list.

There must be a way to retrieve the current state of the list as a JSON string, and a way to restore state from a JSON string.

It should work in IE9+, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. Don't use any external JS libraries.
